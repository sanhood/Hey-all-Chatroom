# *.lock - this is used and abused by many editors for many different things.
#    For the main ones I use (e.g. Eclipse), it should be excluded 
#    from source-control, but YMMV.
#   (lock files are usually local-only file-synchronization on the local FS that should NOT go in git)
# c.f. the "OPTIONAL" section at bottom though, for tool-specific variations!
#
# In particular, if you're using CocoaPods, you'll want to comment-out this line:
# *.lock


#
# profile - REMOVED temporarily (on double-checking, I can't find it in OS X docs?)
